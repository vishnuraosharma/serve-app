# Serve

Roughly 1 in 3 senior citizens in the United States live below the Federal Poverty Line. With **Serve**, this population gains access to essential Convenience, Health, Legal, and Connection services. 

## What is Serve?
Serve is a Java Desktop application that motivates community members & specialists to consciously build their community through volunteerism.
- Senior citizen "Clients" and community volunteers apply and are vetted thoroughly by Serve's in-house Application Manager
- Participating Grocery Stores and Pharmacies curate a discounted convenience product catalog
- Community Members deliver client-ordered convenience products
- Healthcare and Legal organizations set-up a catalog of specialized services and register Serve-verified physicians and lawyers to fulfill client requests
- Schools and other Community Organizations (Boy Scouts of America) manage a catalog of activities aimed to engage seniors on a human level; volunteer cohorts sign-up for activities on client request
